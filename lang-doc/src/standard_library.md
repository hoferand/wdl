# Standard Library

In this chapter, the standard library is documented. Because the standard library is strictly typed, this chapter not only deals with the provided [modules](standard_library/modules.md) but also provides the [type signatures](standard_library/modules.md) of the input types and the returned types of these functions.

<div class="warning">
<strong>Return types</strong>

All functions which returns <code>void</code> can get another return type at any release.

All object return types can be extended by additional members at any release.

Furthermore, the return values of callback functions, which currently should return <code>void</code>, may be ignored for now, but that can change in any future release.
